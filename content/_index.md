# Welcome to my Personal Website!

## Who am I?

Hi! My name is Muhammed Daniyal. I am a teenager. I'm still young so I still have *alot* to learn ðŸ˜…. I have been interested in tech ever since I got my first device(it was an ipad). And have not stopped since.

This blog is a place where I would like to share all the information that I have collected. I choose this theme because it was the most simplest. I see most blogs and/or websites nowadays have a butt-ton on javascript, fluff and bloat that is not necessary at all.

## Whos is this for?

This blog is for people:

* Who love anything Tech. While I will also talk about other topics, most post will be about something 
related to tech

* Books/Comics(Manga). I love to read non-fiction books, mainly business and self-help. In the fiction genre, I like reading Manga/Comics.
