## Intro - Why you NEED Hugo

TO all the countless websites that I have been to, most of them are... shall I say **BLOATED**.

The reason for this is because most websites are built with frameworks/technologies that are bloated
themselves. Stuff like Wordpress, frameworks like React. Just to print a goddamn hello world. It's Insanity!
For a website built with wordpress to load, you would need to contact the backend, you would also be using
a database. All this adds to the bloat and this is why it takes soo long for a website to load nowadays.

This is where hugo comes. *Hugo is a simple static website generator*. When using hugo, you write your
posts in markdown and it compiles all that code into plain html files. No backend, No database, No 
frontend framework. Now mind you this can be changed with tweaks and what not, but out of the box this
is how hugo works. Using hugo you can make websites that take milliseconds to load, in which the entire 
website is only a few **kilobytes**.

Hugo also uses whats called [Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to customize the look and fuctionality of 
the website. There are hundreds of themes, and if you do not like them you can make your own! This means
hugo has pretty much limitless potential when it comes to making websites.

So now that you're convinced, lets see how to get started!

## How to Get Started With Hugo

So, first things first, you got to install hugo on to your system. Hugo supports pretty much all operating
systems so there should not really be a big problem in that department.

To install hugo, you can simply click **[HERE](https://gohugo.io/installation/)**, then choose
your operating system and follow the instructions.

Alright so now that you have done that, it's time for the *fun part!*

*Firstly*, open up your terminal.

Then go to the folder where the source code of the site would be stored. *Remember* Hugo will 
automatically create a folder inside the selected folder. To create a new site simply type in the 
terminal: 

```bash
hugo new site {SITE NAME}
```

*Remember* Replace the "{SITE NAME}" with the name of the site you would like.

This will create a directory in the selected folder with the name that you supplied in the above command.

## Configuring and Adding Themes

Now that we have a hugo site, we need to customize it and add a theme. You can
choose whatever theme you like but I will be using the [Hugo Bear Blog Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearblog/)(It is the same theme that I am using right now!)

*Reminder* You will need to install **Git**. If it is not installed, click [HERE](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to install it.

Now, in the terminal, change your directory to the new folder created by hugo(usind the cd command). Then initialize a git repository by typing:

```bash
git init
```

Now, you will need to put the source code of the theme in to the themes/{THEME_NAME} folder. The "{THEME_NAME}"
can be whatever name you want. If you are using some other theme, the README(on both github and hugo themes) 
should give you the download steps. If you want to stick with me and use the hugo bear blog theme than simply 
just type this: 
 
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog.git themes/hugo-bearblog
```

*Reminder* Make sure that the current working directory that you are in is the directory that hugo created. If
not then it will give you an error.

After that's done, open up the config.toml file(with your favorite editor) and add this line:

```toml
theme = '{THEME_NAME}'
```

*Reminder* Make sure that the "{THEME_NAME}" is matching the name of the theme in the themes folder.

Now, to check to see if everythings working you can go to your terminal and type:

```bash
hugo server
```

This should host a server at localhost:1313, visit the website and you should see an empty page. Now before we
start adding content, we need to paste a example config.toml file and edit it  to make it easier for us to 
configure and add stuff. You can get this file from the themes github page. If you are using my theme than just
remove everything in the config.toml file and then paste this:

```toml
# Base URL used when generating links to your pages
# Set to the URL for your site
baseURL = "https://example.com"

# The name of this wonderful theme ;-).
theme = 'hugo-bearblog'

# Basic metadata configuration for your blog.
title = "Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog"
author = "Jane Doe"
copyright = "Copyright © 2020, Jane Doe."
languageCode = "en-US"

# Generate a nice robots.txt for SEO
enableRobotsTXT = true

# Generate "Bearblog"-like URLs !only!, see https://bearblog.dev/.
disableKinds = ["taxonomy"]
ignoreErrors = ["error-disable-taxonomy"]
[permalinks]
  blog = "/:slug/"
  tags = "/blog/:slug"

[params]
  # The "description" of your website. This is used in the meta data of your generated html.
  description = "Hugo + Bear = :heart:"

  # The path to your "favicon". This should be a square (at least 32px x 32px) png-file.
  # Hint: It's good practise to also put a "favicon.ico"-file into your "static"-folder.
  favicon = "images/favicon.png"

  # These "images" are used for the structured data templates. This will show up, when
  # services like Twitter or Slack want to generate a preview of a link to your site.
  # See https://gohugo.io/templates/internal#twitter-cards and
  # https://gohugo.io/templates/internal#open-graph.
  images = ["images/share.png"]

  # Another "title" :-). This one is used as the site_name on the Hugo's internal
  # opengraph structured data template.
  # See https://ogp.me/ and https://gohugo.io/templates/internal#open-graph.
  title = "Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear"

  # This theme will, by default, inject a made-with-line at the bottom of the page.
  # You can turn it off, but we would really appreciate if you don’t :-).
  # hideMadeWithLine = true

  # By default, this theme displays dates with a format like "02 Jan, 2006", but
  # you can customize it by setting the `dateFormat` param in your site's config
  # file. See [Hugo's Format function docs](https://gohugo.io/functions/format/)
  # for details. An example TOML config that uses [ISO
  # 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:
  # dateFormat = "2006-01-02"
```

Now you can personalize this file by changing all the values, I will not explain the values because 
the comments pretty much explain everything.

## Adding Content
If you want to edit what you see in the Home tab simply add a _index.md file in the content folder.
The content folder is where you will have to store all your posts/pages/etc. To create this file
you should use hugo to add meta data:

```bash
hugo new _index.md
```

When you open the file, you should see some meta data, edit the title. And when you are ready to publish the 
website you can set true to false.

To add posts simple create a folder in the content directory and then add all your posts, again, you should
do this using hugo:

```bash
hugo new posts/hello.md
```

To add images, you have to upload them in the static directory, you can make sub-folders like "images" in the
static folder but it **must** all contain inside the static directory. So for example if there was a file in the
static directory, called "file.png", to use it in one of your posts, type this:

```markdown
![Image Alt]("file.png")
```
If you are not familiar with how to write markdown(which you should be). Click [HERE](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to go to a cheatsheet.

To add a page, you will need to configure your *config.toml* file. Add this at the end of the file to add the "Archives" page

```toml
[[menu.main]]
url = "/posts"
name = "Archive"
weight = 1
```

The name is what will be displayed on the site, the url is where it will go, and the weight is it's position after the Home page. So 1 
would mean right after the Home page.

Now let's create a custom page. Before we do this we need to get some information about the page. If you want to create
a "about me" page. The url could be something link /about. **This means we need to create a about.md file in the content folder:**

```bash
hugo new about.md
```

Now in the markdown file, add whatever you want in the contents. And whenever you are ready set draft to false.

*That's It!* That was the basics of how to create a hugo site. All you need to do is host it so anyone can access it.

## Hosting and Deployment

There are multiple places where you can host your site, some are free while others are paid. As a begginer I would recommend
netlify or github pages. At the time of writing this, this site is hosted with github pages!

Hugo details hosting and deployment in their docs (Click [HERE](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/)).

## Other Helpfull resources

There are *many* other resources to learn hugo. So if you need more tutorials on some more advanced topics or just did not
